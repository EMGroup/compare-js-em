# Compare JavaScript and EM

A demo page showing comparable code examples in Construit script and JavaScript
to illustrate the differences. This has been produced for a talk at the
[first international conference on making construals](http://edumotiva.eu/construit2017/).

**Try it out!** - http://emgroup.github.io/compare-js-em

The focus of the demos is on maximising reusability and adaptability whilst
minimizing effort and expertise of the original developer. The claim being made
is that using structural mechanisms to aid reusability is a fallacy that results
in often less reusable and more complex code.
